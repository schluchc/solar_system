# Solar System WebGL

This is a browser-based version of the solar system demo using Three.js and WebGL.

## Run locally

Because the app uses ES modules, serve the repo from a local web server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000/web/
```

## Notes

- Textures are loaded from `../assets/textures`.
- Controls are listed in the in-page HUD.
